# Transport-problem-LPP

A program that allows you to perform calculations of open and closed transport problems 
by reducing them to a linear programming problem. 
Currently, there are 2 localizations: Russian and English versions. 
For instructions on how to work write to the mail st.tell@mail.ru


When creating the program, Python version 3.6.9 was used.
For successful use, SciPy must be installed in the project.

The program receives the following data from the user(they will be requested in the console window): 
supplier capacities, 
consumer requests, 
table of prices for transportation between each supplier and the consumer. 

IMPORTANT! 
All data is entered in a single line separated by a space.
